When the multiple field is set to true, RabbitMQ will acknowledge all outstanding delivery tags up to and including the tag specified in the acknowledgement.
For example, given that there are delivery tags 5, 6, 7, and 8 unacknowledged on channel, when an acknowledgement frame arrives on that channel with delivery_tag set to 8 and multiple set to true, all tags from 5 to 8 will be acknowledged.
If multiple was set to false, deliveries 5, 6, and 7 would still be unacknowledged.
